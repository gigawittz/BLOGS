<p><b>Since the outbreak of the Covid -19 , whole world is waiting for vaccination with the gasping breath, after Dr. Faucci’s statement in a media briefing that vaccination of COVID-19 will be achieved within 18 months . A very positive but somehow hard to achieve commitment, As the science and technology now a days is far more advanced .But we should be aware that the vaccine development isn’t as simple and fast process as we assume. The very first vaccine was developed Edward Jenner (for small pox) approx. 200 year ago ,before it humanity either survived n the Darwin’s principles or through the natural phenomenon of  herd immunity, but after that many more vaccines for different diseases has been developed , According to WHO every year vaccines save lives of  more than 2.4million new born babies from the diseases that were considered fatal at some point of time.even after such drastic medical advancement the process of vaccine development is still very slow , till today the fastest ever developed vaccine took record  time of 4 years . and in such scenario where more than 8 strains of the COVID-19 virus has been observed assuming that we will have its vaccine by 18months is really going to be a miracle . There are few diseases for which we still don’t have vaccine are<b>-</p>
	<br>
1-	HIV- the first case was traced 4 decades ago and as of now more than 32million people had died due to it and still no vaccines available.<br>
2-	Malaria- sounds shocking but yes we still don’t have any vaccine for it even after 23crore cases and 4 lakh deaths annually.<br>
3-	Dengue- vaccine developed but failed recently as it worsened the symptoms of dengue.                    <br>                           
<p>Here my point is not to demoralize you but to think about new “NORMAL LIFE STYLE” that nature had introduced to us , this new lifestyle is more disciplined and more strict about rituals and hygiene than the earlier used to be, In our new life style the punishment for not following cautious approach towards life will not only affect you but also your loved ones , this new way of living will require us to lead a life with more awareness because we belong to a society where we forget to wear helmets, how will we be able to always carry the masks with us .Its high time to introspect ourselves. Nature has its own ways to remind us our limitations, and we are bound to follow it because there are no if’s and no but’s in nature’s book.
